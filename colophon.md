This website was written with [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/),
[vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)),
[ed(1)](https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/), and
[qed](https://github.com/phonologus/qed-new), depending on my mood and the
context. It uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and (usually GNU)
[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for rendering,
and [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

That's about it, really.
