## This website

was written with [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/),
[vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi_(text_editor)),
[ed(1)](https://www.gnu.org/software/ed/), and
[qed](https://github.com/phonologus/qed-new), depending on my mood and the
context. It uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
and GNU [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for rendering,
and [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

Some of the pages use other tools, like
[Kallychore](https://github.com/evanswinner/kallychore) and
[whatver](https://github.com/evanswinner/whatver) (both are tools I wrote) and
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and other standard Unix utilities.

I'm writing on a 2013 Macbook Pro runnning Ubuntu right now.

## General preferences

But since you asked, over the years I've done a lot of distro-hopping, window
manager-hopping, editor-hopping, terminal emulator-hopping, browser-hopping,
email client-hopping, and shell-hopping, and the bottom line is, while I tend to
lean toward simpler-is-better, [Unix
philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/),
"[suckless](https://suckless.org/)" tools, I also like a good web browser and a
good Lisp machine emulator/text editor (read: Emacs) so it really just depends
on what exactly you want to be doing. There is no one single tool for everything
(no, not even Emacs). But for what it's worth, here's my general list. Only
things that are reasonably good for something are below. I leave off anything
that I would generally avoid.
