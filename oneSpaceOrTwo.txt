One Space or Two

[Originally posted on ttlaxia.net [2012‐09‐28 Fri]

There  seems to be an eternal debate among writers
(and those who hate them) about the relative  mer‐
its  of  inserting  one  space or two between sen‐
tences.  (See, Mark Barrett’s blog post for an in‐
teresting and unusually even‐keeled example.)  The
question itself is misleading in every sense,  but
to the extent that it is a meaningful one, the an‐
swer will come by  asking  what,  exactly,  is  at
stake  in the issue.  There are several possibili‐
ties, including the sanity of publishing  editors,
the  tired fingers of authors, the beauty of docu‐
ments, or the ease with which we use  those  docu‐
ments.  The future of Western Civilization may not
be at stake in the sense that if we today omit  to
insert  an  extra  space  after our full stops, we
shall surely be shoveling babies into ovens tomor‐
row;  but  somebody  thinks something is at stake—
else why all the vitriol?

In the realm of computer programs, the  desiderata
for  an  editor  of  text  are, as the programmers
would put it, orthogonal to those for a typesetter
of  text.   Attempts  at integrating the two func‐
tions into a single, graphical program  have  pro‐
duced mongrels like Microsoft Word, and OpenOffice
Writer, which perform neither function well.   For
example,  one  may  examine texts rendered by such
programs side‐by‐side, justified and not, and con‐
clude,  as  Barrett  does, that justification pro‐
duces undesirable spacing byproducts, particularly
when sentence ends are double‐spaced; but the com‐
parison tells us only that the typesetting engines
used  are  unable to intelligently hyphenate.  Hy‐
phenation is not merely a minor side issue, but is
critical  to any proper attempt at justified type‐
setting, and for precisely this reason.   One  may
indeed  suggest  the  use  of such word‐processing
programs for the quick and easy production of par‐
ty  flyers,  but  for serious writing, there is no
substitute for a real, professional‐grade text ed‐
itor;  and  as for typesetting the resulting text,
that is not the job of the writer, qua writer, but
of  a typesetter.  The two functions may reside in
one and the same person, just as they  may  reside
in one and the same computer program (usually with
the same quality of result) but they remain never‐
theless  distinct  functions  of  the  process  of
bringing text to readers.

Furthermore, space is not a discrete, but  a  con‐
tinuous  quantity, as the mathematicians would put
it.  A paper‐and‐ink  document  does  not  contain
one,  or  two, spaces after a sentence, but rather
it contains some single quantity of  space,  large
or  small, however produced.  The notion of reduc‐
ing this measure to the simple level of  one  dis‐
crete  lump  or two stems, as has been pointed out
many times, from the Age of Mechanization; but  if
the  secretarial  poolies  of old found themselves
resorting to the  expedient  of  adding  an  extra
space  after  a sentence, it is premature to leave
the issue at that, with a dismissive wave  of  the
hand.  An extra keystroke after every sentence is,
if nothing else, inefficient; and if there is any‐
thing  which  a  professional typist abhors, it is
waste.  We must ask therefore why  the  habit  was
formed  and  reinforced  despite the added effort;
and the answer is of course that in its crude way,
the insertion of an extra space character simulat‐
ed the extra space which the typists were used  to
seeing in actual typeset material.

About  such  material  one gathers several things:
first, that in the  modern  world,  the  habit  of
adding  a  little extra space after a sentence‐end
has waned.  Perhaps, as the Marxists will no‐doubt
conclude, it is because it costs less to mass‐pro‐
duce material which  packs  more  into  a  smaller
space—whitespace  costs  money;  perhaps it is be‐
cause an algorithm which can intelligently account
for  all the interbalanced and sometimes conflict‐
ing factors involved in real typesetting is devil‐
ishly  difficult to write, and therefore expensive
to produce and complex and difficult to  learn  to
use—and  if  there  is one thing few but engineers
seem to want, it is to learn to use TeX;  or  per‐
haps,  as  the  deteriorationists  will inevitably
conclude, it is simply because  modern  man  lacks
the sophistication of taste of which his noble an‐
cestor was possessed.  Second,  in  older  typeset
material,  it seems that the habit of adding extra
space tends to be something  of  an  English  (and
therefore  American)  trait.   The  Latinate  (and
therefore Continental) habit is to  space  between
sentences  as between words.  The American typists
imitated  the  typesetters  of  their  country  by
adding an extra space; the French did not; and now
we have the phrase “French spacing” to denote  the
omission  of that second space.  The argument that
double‐spacing is only an accident of the  history
of  the mechanical typewriter itself brushes aside
the long history of typesetting with  extra  space
between  sentences which the English‐speaking typ‐
ists sought to imitate.

It is important to realize, however, that the  ad‐
dition of that extra spacing character is, just as
I’ve said, an imitation.  It is a visual imitation
of  what  is itself, at least in part, a mark with
semantic meaning.  If we choose to mark the end of
a sentence with the same sort of space that we use
to mark the space between words (a space which it‐
self  is  conventional,  as  a glance at old Latin
texts will show) that later space is  nevertheless
semantically distinct from the former, because the
structure  which  it  distinguishes  is  distinct.
There  is no merit in the argument that a space is
a space is a space.  Because a sentence is  not  a
word,  a  sentence space is not a word space; even
when the current fashion of typesetting makes them
visually  indistinguishable,  they remain semanti‐
cally distinct.  Just as an indentation in printed
material  (or  some less felicitous means in HTML‐
typeset material) is  used  to  differentiate  one
paragraph  from  the next, we use certain marks to
set off one sentence from the next.  They  include
capitalizing the first letter of the new sentence,
using a mark of punctuation like the period,  and,
in some circumstances, we add a little extra space
between the sentences.

This much, in itself, seems an argument  in  favor
of the double‐spacing habit.  (As an aside, my own
text editor of choice, GNU  Emacs,  makes  use  of
this  fact by defining a large number of functions
whose purpose is to  operate  on  individual  sen‐
tences  as  a  whole.   The ability, with a single
keystroke, to move the cursor one  sentence  at  a
time,  to mark off individual sentences, no matter
how long, or how many lines they may occupy, is  a
useful  and  valuable one; and it is only possible
when those sentences  are  distinguished  distinc‐
tively;  therefore Emacs treats two spaces follow‐
ing a sentence‐ending punctuation mark as the  de‐
limiter  of  a sentence.  Such functions could not
work without such a unique combination to  distin‐
guish a sentence.)  But of course, it is not real‐
ly clarity in the semantic sense which the  propo‐
nents  of  double‐spacing seek, but rather clarity
in the visual sense—the sense of ease and  comfort
of  reading.  Indeed, one requires no spaces what‐
ever between sentences to make  them  semantically
clear—that function is amply fulfilled by the mark
of punctuation and the following capital, mediated
by  a little intelligent sensitivity to context on
the part of the reader.  (One cites Wikipedia  ad‐
visedly, but according to that source, studies re‐
garding the effect of end‐of‐sentence  spacing  on
text comprehension have been inconclusive.)

Some  typesetters  might  claim that extra spacing
makes unsightly gaps in a text, and, if a page  is
looked at as a dead blob of color on paper, rather
than as a sequence of living  ideas  expressed  in
text,  then  they  are quite right; but it remains
debatable whether such gaps or rivers through  the
text distract, as some might claim.  One might ar‐
gue, after all, that yes,  there  is  no  evidence
that extra space between sentences makes text eas‐
ier to read; but to argue that there is, in  prin‐
ciple,  no  value in using some whitespace to make
reading easier and more pleasant  commits  one  to
the same position with regard to paragraph breaks—
a frightful thought.   You  may  like  some  extra
space  between sentences in typeset material, as I
do, because those gaps make landmarks which render
it easier to sense where one is in a block of oth‐
erwise unyielding text.  Quite arguably, the  vis‐
ual  homogeneity  which  is held up as an ideal by
some typesetters is actually a hindrance to pleas‐
ant  reading.  There is no really good facility in
HTML and CSS which allows  double‐spaced  sentence
ends;  and  there  is  no  point in tilting at the
windmill of the medium in which one  works.   Edi‐
tors,  intelligent, enlightened, or otherwise, may
demand work done in one way or  the  other—another
fight  not  worth the ink.  A text editing program
may seem to urge one way or the other; thus.  Fur‐
thermore,  if  text  is fed into a typesetting en‐
gine, it will collapse multiple spaces  into  one—
one  which may or may not, depending on the intel‐
ligence of the program, and the taste of its oper‐
ator,  be  larger than an inter‐word space; there‐
fore, other things being equal, for text  intended
to  be typeset in any sense at all, it matters not
one bit how many  spaces  one  uses  between  sen‐
tences.   As  for informal communications, such as
emails, the answer is that it does not matter pre‐
cisely  because the medium is informal; and as for
the use of monospaced typefaces, it is  true  that
the  double  space  can  appear  excessive in that
case, but the very use of a monospace typeface in‐
dicates that we are not discussing serious typeset
material — one uses such fonts now only for  writ‐
ing  computer  code and for certain fanciful sorts
of decoration—not for running text.

So, should you use two spaces or one?  If you  are
not actually typesetting text, it does not matter,
but it doesn’t hurt, unless  you  have  reason  to
suspect that it will prejudice your editor against
you.  Might it bother your editor?  Evidently,  it
is  possible.   It seems that people with an irra‐
tional prejudice against double‐spacing  are  more
common and more vitriolic than those with a preju‐
dice for.  If you are typesetting your text,  even
for  the  Web, then once again, it doesn’t matter,
as the typesetting engine will collapse the  extra
space  into  one.   If  someone complains that the
typeset results contain those extra  spaces,  then
they  are almost certainly trying to use a child’s
toy—a word processing  program—to  do  an  adult’s
job.   And if your text editor functions more use‐
fully if you do double‐space, then it  won’t  hurt
to  do so.  I myself find that even in a monospace
typeface on my text editor’s screen, my own  writ‐
ing  is  easier for me to read with double spaces,
so I use them even for my  own  manuscripts.   And
for  an email?  Again, it does not matter.  So, if
you already have the habit, there is little reason
to reform; and if you don’t, there is no more rea‐
son to change.

The real question, then, has nothing  to  do  with
the  typing  habits  of  all  those poor, harassed
writers, whose job is naught but to produce  mean‐
ingful  text,  but  with  the work of typesetters,
whose job is to render  that  text—not  beautiful,
but  ergonomic.   It is reduced to the question of
whether serious, typeset running text (not  merely
authors’  manuscripts)  should be set with—no, not
“two spaces,” but with a little more space  kerned
in  between  sentences.   One may point to history
and find that it’s been done both ways for a  long
time.  One may point to science and find little to
prove one way or the other.

But does this mean that the issue is entirely sub‐
jective?   Perhaps  not.   The desire to eradicate
the visual distinction between words  and  phrases
on  the one hand, and sentences, on the other, im‐
plies a desire, or a least a willingness (even  if
born  only  of insensitivity) to eradicate the se‐
mantic distinction.  If the implication of the  “a
space  is  a  space”  argument  is  that words and
clauses and phrases are  no  different  from  sen‐
tences;  then  what  may  be at stake, albeit in a
very small way, is the  appreciation  our  culture
has for the importance—the vital importance—of the
concept of the sentence itself,  as  properly  not
more and no less than the complete expression of a
complete thought.  I admit that the connection  is
slight  and tenuous; nevertheless one might indeed
see the tendency to lose the graphical distinction
between a sentence‐end and a phrase‐end as sympto‐
matic of a general insensitivity to  the  distinc‐
tion between the two kinds of structure, as anoth‐
er effect of the same cause which  is  behind  the
general atomization which seems to have taken hold
of modern writing.  The atomization  of  sentences
implies  the  atomization  of  thought.  What once
might have been written as a single  flowing  sen‐
tence  consisting  of clear premises followed by a
conclusion is now replaced  with  the  machine‐gun
stutter of seemingly unrelated assertions.  No, we
will not all die tomorrow if we allow ourselves to
habitually  begin our sentences with the word but;
but that we live in a culture which has  lost  the
sense of why such a thing might be infelicitous in
many contexts is indication that the  sense  of  a
sentence  has  been  largely  lost.   Perhaps then
that, if not proves, at any rate may explain  some
prejudice  against  the single‐spacing habit, even
where we might all admit that it  is,  after  all,
not really an important issue in itself.
