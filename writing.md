title: Miscellaneous Writing Tidbits (with more TBD)
author: E. Hawthorne Winner

I used to write a bit on Æsthetics, particularly from a Randian
perspective. Maybe one day I will clean something up and put it back
online. (Once upon the time, back in the stone age of the Internet —
the late 1990s — I and some friends ran the prehistoric equivalent of
a blog. It was called Apollo's Soapbox. If you were really obsessed,
you could probably find it on the Wayback Machine.)

# Nerdy
