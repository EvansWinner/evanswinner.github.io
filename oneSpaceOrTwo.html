<h1 id="one-space-or-two">One Space or Two</h1>
<p>[Originally posted on ttlaxia.net [2012-09-28 Fri]</p>
<p>There seems to be an eternal debate among writers (and those who hate
them) about the relative merits of inserting one space or two between
sentences. (See, Mark Barrett’s blog post for an interesting and
unusually even-keeled example.) The question itself is misleading in
every sense, but to the extent that it is a meaningful one, the answer
will come by asking what, exactly, is at stake in the issue. There are
several possibilities, including the sanity of publishing editors, the
tired fingers of authors, the beauty of documents, or the ease with
which we use those documents. The future of Western Civilization may not
be at stake in the sense that if we today omit to insert an extra space
after our full stops, we shall surely be shoveling babies into ovens
tomorrow; but somebody thinks something is at stake—else why all the
vitriol?</p>
<p>In the realm of computer programs, the desiderata for an editor of
text are, as the programmers would put it, orthogonal to those for a
typesetter of text. Attempts at integrating the two functions into a
single, graphical program have produced mongrels like Microsoft Word,
and OpenOffice Writer, which perform neither function well. For example,
one may examine texts rendered by such programs side-by-side, justified
and not, and conclude, as Barrett does, that justification produces
undesirable spacing byproducts, particularly when sentence ends are
double-spaced; but the comparison tells us only that the typesetting
engines used are unable to intelligently hyphenate. Hyphenation is not
merely a minor side issue, but is critical to any proper attempt at
justified typesetting, and for precisely this reason. One may indeed
suggest the use of such word-processing programs for the quick and easy
production of party flyers, but for serious writing, there is no
substitute for a real, professional-grade text editor; and as for
typesetting the resulting text, that is not the job of the writer, qua
writer, but of a typesetter. The two functions may reside in one and the
same person, just as they may reside in one and the same computer
program (usually with the same quality of result) but they remain
nevertheless distinct functions of the process of bringing text to
readers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, space is not a discrete, but a continuous quantity, as
the mathematicians would put it. A paper-and-ink document does not
contain one, or two, spaces after a sentence, but rather it contains
some single quantity of space, large or small, however produced. The
notion of reducing this measure to the simple level of one discrete lump
or two stems, as has been pointed out many times, from the Age of
Mechanization; but if the secretarial poolies of old found themselves
resorting to the expedient of adding an extra space after a sentence, it
is premature to leave the issue at that, with a dismissive wave of the
hand. An extra keystroke after every sentence is, if nothing else,
inefficient; and if there is anything which a professional typist
abhors, it is waste. We must ask therefore why the habit was formed and
reinforced despite the added effort; and the answer is of course that in
its crude way, the insertion of an extra space character simulated the
extra space which the typists were used to seeing in actual typeset
material.</p>
<p>About such material one gathers several things: first, that in the
modern world, the habit of adding a little extra space after a
sentence-end has waned. Perhaps, as the Marxists will no-doubt conclude,
it is because it costs less to mass-produce material which packs more
into a smaller space—whitespace costs money; perhaps it is because an
algorithm which can intelligently account for all the interbalanced and
sometimes conflicting factors involved in real typesetting is devilishly
difficult to write, and therefore expensive to produce and complex and
difficult to learn to use—and if there is one thing few but engineers
seem to want, it is to learn to use TeX; or perhaps, as the
deteriorationists will inevitably conclude, it is simply because modern
man lacks the sophistication of taste of which his noble ancestor was
possessed. Second, in older typeset material, it seems that the habit of
adding extra space tends to be something of an English (and therefore
American) trait. The Latinate (and therefore Continental) habit is to
space between sentences as between words. The American typists imitated
the typesetters of their country by adding an extra space; the French
did not; and now we have the phrase “French spacing” to denote the
omission of that second space. The argument that double-spacing is only
an accident of the history of the mechanical typewriter itself brushes
aside the long history of typesetting with extra space between sentences
which the English-speaking typists sought to imitate.</p>
<p>It is important to realize, however, that the addition of that extra
spacing character is, just as I’ve said, an imitation. It is a visual
imitation of what is itself, at least in part, a mark with semantic
meaning. If we choose to mark the end of a sentence with the same sort
of space that we use to mark the space between words (a space which
itself is conventional, as a glance at old Latin texts will show) that
later space is nevertheless semantically distinct from the former,
because the structure which it distinguishes is distinct. There is no
merit in the argument that a space is a space is a space. Because a
sentence is not a word, a sentence space is not a word space; even when
the current fashion of typesetting makes them visually
indistinguishable, they remain semantically distinct. Just as an
indentation in printed material (or some less felicitous means in
HTML-typeset material) is used to differentiate one paragraph from the
next, we use certain marks to set off one sentence from the next. They
include capitalizing the first letter of the new sentence, using a mark
of punctuation like the period, and, in some circumstances, we add a
little extra space between the sentences.</p>
<p>This much, in itself, seems an argument in favor of the
double-spacing habit. (As an aside, my own text editor of choice, GNU
Emacs, makes use of this fact by defining a large number of functions
whose purpose is to operate on individual sentences as a whole. The
ability, with a single keystroke, to move the cursor one sentence at a
time, to mark off individual sentences, no matter how long, or how many
lines they may occupy, is a useful and valuable one; and it is only
possible when those sentences are distinguished distinctively; therefore
Emacs treats two spaces following a sentence-ending punctuation mark as
the delimiter of a sentence. Such functions could not work without such
a unique combination to distinguish a sentence.) But of course, it is
not really clarity in the semantic sense which the proponents of
double-spacing seek, but rather clarity in the visual sense—the sense of
ease and comfort of reading. Indeed, one requires no spaces whatever
between sentences to make them semantically clear—that function is amply
fulfilled by the mark of punctuation and the following capital, mediated
by a little intelligent sensitivity to context on the part of the
reader. (One cites Wikipedia advisedly, but according to that source,
studies regarding the effect of end-of-sentence spacing on text
comprehension have been inconclusive.)</p>
<p>Some typesetters might claim that extra spacing makes unsightly gaps
in a text, and, if a page is looked at as a dead blob of color on paper,
rather than as a sequence of living ideas expressed in text, then they
are quite right; but it remains debatable whether such gaps or rivers
through the text distract, as some might claim. One might argue, after
all, that yes, there is no evidence that extra space between sentences
makes text easier to read; but to argue that there is, in principle, no
value in using some whitespace to make reading easier and more pleasant
commits one to the same position with regard to paragraph breaks—a
frightful thought. You may like some extra space between sentences in
typeset material, as I do, because those gaps make landmarks which
render it easier to sense where one is in a block of otherwise
unyielding text. Quite arguably, the visual homogeneity which is held up
as an ideal by some typesetters is actually a hindrance to pleasant
reading. There is no really good facility in HTML and CSS which allows
double-spaced sentence ends; and there is no point in tilting at the
windmill of the medium in which one works. Editors, intelligent,
enlightened, or otherwise, may demand work done in one way or the
other—another fight not worth the ink. A text editing program may seem
to urge one way or the other; thus. Furthermore, if text is fed into a
typesetting engine, it will collapse multiple spaces into one—one which
may or may not, depending on the intelligence of the program, and the
taste of its operator, be larger than an inter-word space; therefore,
other things being equal, for text intended to be typeset in any sense
at all, it matters not one bit how many spaces one uses between
sentences. As for informal communications, such as emails, the answer is
that it does not matter precisely because the medium is informal; and as
for the use of monospaced typefaces, it is true that the double space
can appear excessive in that case, but the very use of a monospace
typeface indicates that we are not discussing serious typeset material —
one uses such fonts now only for writing computer code and for certain
fanciful sorts of decoration—not for running text.</p>
<p>So, should you use two spaces or one? If you are not actually
typesetting text, it does not matter, but it doesn’t hurt, unless you
have reason to suspect that it will prejudice your editor against you.
Might it bother your editor? Evidently, it is possible. It seems that
people with an irrational prejudice against double-spacing are more
common and more vitriolic than those with a prejudice for. If you are
typesetting your text, even for the Web, then once again, it doesn’t
matter, as the typesetting engine will collapse the extra space into
one. If someone complains that the typeset results contain those extra
spaces, then they are almost certainly trying to use a child’s toy—a
word processing program—to do an adult’s job. And if your text editor
functions more usefully if you do double-space, then it won’t hurt to do
so. I myself find that even in a monospace typeface on my text editor’s
screen, my own writing is easier for me to read with double spaces, so I
use them even for my own manuscripts. And for an email? Again, it does
not matter. So, if you already have the habit, there is little reason to
reform; and if you don’t, there is no more reason to change.</p>
<p>The real question, then, has nothing to do with the typing habits of
all those poor, harassed writers, whose job is naught but to produce
meaningful text, but with the work of typesetters, whose job is to
render that text—not beautiful, but ergonomic. It is reduced to the
question of whether serious, typeset running text (not merely authors’
manuscripts) should be set with—no, not “two spaces,” but with a little
more space kerned in between sentences. One may point to history and
find that it’s been done both ways for a long time. One may point to
science and find little to prove one way or the other.</p>
<p>But does this mean that the issue is entirely subjective? Perhaps
not. The desire to eradicate the visual distinction between words and
phrases on the one hand, and sentences, on the other, implies a desire,
or a least a willingness (even if born only of insensitivity) to
eradicate the semantic distinction. If the implication of the “a space
is a space” argument is that words and clauses and phrases are no
different from sentences; then what may be at stake, albeit in a very
small way, is the appreciation our culture has for the importance—the
vital importance—of the concept of the sentence itself, as properly not
more and no less than the complete expression of a complete thought. I
admit that the connection is slight and tenuous; nevertheless one might
indeed see the tendency to lose the graphical distinction between a
sentence-end and a phrase-end as symptomatic of a general insensitivity
to the distinction between the two kinds of structure, as another effect
of the same cause which is behind the general atomization which seems to
have taken hold of modern writing. The atomization of sentences implies
the atomization of thought. What once might have been written as a
single flowing sentence consisting of clear premises followed by a
conclusion is now replaced with the machine-gun stutter of seemingly
unrelated assertions. No, we will not all die tomorrow if we allow
ourselves to habitually begin our sentences with the word but; but that
we live in a culture which has lost the sense of why such a thing might
be infelicitous in many contexts is indication that the sense of a
sentence has been largely lost. Perhaps then that, if not proves, at any
rate may explain some prejudice against the single-spacing habit, even
where we might all admit that it is, after all, not really an important
issue in itself.</p>
