i# STEAL THIS CD

In  my day‐job, clerking in the music department of a large,
chain bookstore, it is often my duty to flip,  compact  disc
by  compact  disc,  through  our inventory, in search of the
small magnetic stickers the company affixes to  the  record‐
ings as theft preventers.  Found cut from the packaging cel‐
lophane and wadded between disks, they are the telltale sign
of  an attempt to steal the disk from which they came.  They
are a record (evidence, if you will) of the  musical  tastes
of the larcenously‐inclined segment of our population.

Most  are  stickers for the music of popular rap music acts,
like Eminem or The Black‐Eyed Peas.  Perhaps, then, there is
some  degree of truth to the reputation such music enjoys as
a breeder of anger, hatred, gangsterism, theft, the smacking
up of ’ho’s and the busting of caps.

Perhaps.   But  today,  wadded  up and tucked out of the way
somewhere in the Rachmaninoff section, I found the  security
sticker for Morton Feldman’s ‘Patterns in a Chromatic Field’
for cello and piano.

I’m not making this up.

Certainly, it is more than possible that the  evident  theft
of  one  one of the most anemic, listless pieces of music of
all time, by one of the most emphatically  un‐hip  composers
of  all  time  could  have  been  a mere mistake; a crime of
opportunity committed by the ignorant.  Won’t  the  would‐be
criminal be surprised to hear the results of the theft?–

–just...  one...  note...  at a...  time.

But–and perhaps I’m being sentimental–I prefer to think that
someone walked into that store with one thing on their mind:
“I’m gonna snag me some super‐concentrated, post‐expression‐
ist uber‐modernism.”

And as much as I by‐and‐large can’t  stand  more  than  five
minutes  of Feldman’s music at a time, it does my heart good
to think someone could be willing to go to  that  length  to
listen  to  it.   Because it means someone still cares about
serious music.

If no one riots at premiers anymore, as they famously did in
the  earliest  part of the 20th century, perhaps they can at
least steal Morton Feldman CDs.

It’s a start, at any rate.
