## Experiment & Analysis

<div class="box"> <img src="ultradian.png"
style="max-width:30%;float:left"><b>[Do “ultradian\” rhythms mediate my
productivity throughout the day?](status-log.html)</b> (Local, 2018.1)<br />
An **Rmarkdown** notebook using a small, self-collected dataset.

"It appears that the results, though suggestive of a line with four peaks, could
actually be fit with a line with only a single peak or with a single,
monotonically decreasing curve, and still remain within the 90% CI."</div>

<div class="box"> <img src="spl.jpg"
style="max-width:15%;float:left"><b>[Sound-pressure level at a large
datacenter](dc_spl.html)</b> (Local, 2018.2)<br /> Are sound levels dangerously high? An
**Rmarkdown** notebook examining the question using self-collected
readings.

"Continuous SPL levels in the main datacenter floor are too high for unprotected
long-term exposure. The NIOSH limit for 94 dB is 1 hour, and even assuming a
full 3 dB of inaccuracy in the measurment, at 91 dB, NIOSH still recommends no
more than 2 hours of continuous unprotected exposure. It therefore seems
reasonable to conclude that workers entering the main datacenter floor should
wear ear protection if they expect to be on the floor for more than a few
minutes, and might as well get in the habit of always having ear protection on
hand when entering the main datacenter floor."

## Tools

<div class="box"> <img src="piltdown.jpg"
style="max-width:20%;float:left"><b>[Piltdown](https://github.com/EvansWinner/piltdown)</b>  (GitHub, 2021)<br />
Always wanted to use Python to generate data visualizations for your Twitter
posts using pure Unicode? No? Just me? Well, now you can anyway.
Despite the very tongue-in-cheek README, this does provide Python functions to
generate -- <b>column sparklines</b>, <b>win/lose sparklines</b>, <b>comparison
charts</b>, <b>horizontal bar charts</b>, <b>horizontal and vertical dot
charts</b>, <b>waffle charts</b>, <b>scaled-up
numbers</b>, <b>contingency and other simple tables</b>, and <b>tally charts</b>.</div>

<div class="box"> <img src="kallychore.png"
style="max-width:40%;float:left"><b>[Kallychore](https://github.com/EvansWinner/kallychore)</b> (GitHub, 2018)<br/>
Kallychore is a plain-text code notebook processor for mixing text and bash
code, a little like Rmarkdown mixes Markdown and R. **Bash** with embedded
**awk**.

Rmarkdown is to an interpreted language as Kallychore is to a compiled
one. Kallychore makes a single pass over a plain-text (or Markdown) document
and interprets the embedded code blocks and outputs a single file with text,
code, and code output.<br />
</div>

<div class="box"><b>
<img src="todostack.png" style="max-width:20%;float:left">[Todostack.el](https://github.com/EvansWinner/todostack.el)</b> (GitHub, 2011)<br />
A to-do list as a stack, written in **Emacs Lisp**. Some
[description](http://thornepublic.blogspot.com/2018/03/todostack.html) on
Blogspot. This is for people who have constant interruptions. When something
interrupts you, push a couple of words about what you are doing onto the
stack. Once you get back, pop the stack and see what you were doing.<br />
</div>


## Simulation

simulator written from scratch in **Common Lisp** for some of IBM’s [AJS job
scheduler](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzasn/rzasnajsmanage.htm)
that I actually used for validating schedules on production machines.<br /></div>

<div class="box"><b>[auctions.py](https://gist.github.com/EvansWinner/064932a724caa2c816a768792a6903da)</b> (GitHub Gist, ~2019)<br />
auctions.py is a little eBay auction simulator, using **simpy** in **Python**.<br />
</div>


## Mathy stuff

## Demonstrations

<div class="box"><b>[Set Operations with Bash](sets.html)</b> (Local, 2018.4)<br>

<div class="box"> <b>[A K-nearest neighbor classifier in "pure"
Bash](kNN.html)</b>. (Local, 2019.7)<br /> A demonstration of the power of **bash**,
