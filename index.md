<details><summary>**About me...**</summary>

Hi — I’m Evans Hawthorne Winner, I'm 48 years old, and I like
stuff. I used to be a rock climber in Boulder, later a scuba diver
in Seattle; I studied music composition seriously at university
for several years; later studied literature and philosophy in New
Mexico and even graduated *summa* (gasp!).

I'm back in Colorado now, and like most such people, I ended up as an
IT guy.

My wife
[Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuyqb2sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
is way more interesting than me. She is a computational biologist
turned data curator. My son Taavi is also way more interesting
than me. He is six years old and likes dinosaurs.

<details><summary>**About my work...**</summary>

I have the somewhat ambitiously named "[portfolio](./portfolio.html)"
of miscellaneous nerdy things I've done; a boring
[resume](./resume.html), the obligatory
[Github](https://github.com/evanswinner) page, and a
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanswinner/), and heck, even a
[vCard](./vcard.vcf). Additionally, I've links to some
[writing](./writing.html) (and maybe soon other things) that I did
before I became a family guy with a mortgage and all that.

But that's all in the past: Now I'm an aspiring process improvement
analyst / consultant and stand-up philosopher.
