I am Evans Hawthorne Winner, 50-year-old IT worker living in Evergreen, Colorado.

I used to be a casual rock climber in Boulder,
later a casual scuba diver in Seattle;
I studied music composition fairly seriously at university in Boulder for several years;
later studied literature and philosophy in New Mexico where I finally graduated *Summa*.

**I am looking for more analytical work in process improvement, operations, or systems analysis**.

I have the somewhat ambitiously named "[portfolio](./portfolio.html)"
of miscellaneous nerdy things I've done;
a boring [resume](./resume.html),
the obligatory [Github](https://github.com/evanswinner) page,
a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanswinner/),
and heck, even a [vCard](./vcard.vcf).
Additionally, I've links to some [writing](./writing.html)
(and maybe soon other things)
that I did before I became a family guy with a mortgage and all that.

[My wife, [Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuyqb2sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
is way more interesting than me. She is a computational biologist
turned data curator and R hacker.
My son, Taavi, is also way more interesting than me.
He is eight years old and likes paleontology and Minecraft.]
