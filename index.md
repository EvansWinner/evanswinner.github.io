I am Evans Hawthorne Winner, 51-year-old,
lowly IT worker living in Evergreen, Colorado.
(Drop me a line if you know where I can get analytical work --
data, operations, process, whatever.
I am evans dot winner at Google's famous email domain.)

I used to be a casual rock climber in Boulder,
later a casual scuba diver in Seattle;
I studied music composition fairly seriously at university in Boulder for several years;
later studied literature and philosophy in New Mexico where,
after twenty-something odd years of courses at many schools,
I finally graduated *summa* -- because they only counted their own courses in the GPA.
Ha! Take that, high-school guidance councilors!

I have the somewhat ambitiously named "[portfolio](./portfolio.html)"
of miscellaneous nerdy things I've done;
a boring [resume](./resume.html),
the obligatory [GitHub](https://github.com/evanswinner) page,
a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanswinner/),
and heck, even a [vCard](./vcard.vcf).
Additionally, I've links to some [writing](./writing.html)
(and maybe soon other things)
that I did before I became a family guy with a mortgage and all that.

My wife, [Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuyqb2sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
is way more interesting than me. She is a computational biologist
turned data curator and R hacker.
My son, Taavi, is also way more interesting than me.
He is nine years old and likes paleontology and Minecraft.

**Web Log**

Here follows a 'blog in the old sense of the term:
in something like chronological order,
some of the miscellaneous wreckage
I have strewn across the Internet over the years.
I link to the content instead of include it here inline
except where it is only a few lines long
as in the case of some short poems, aphorisms,
and especially one-liners.
Links are HTTP(S) to HTML pages unless obviously otherwise.
The quality ranges from bad to not so bad. Sue me.
Also, this is not a historical record,
so I edit freely where I want to.

Most (but not all) comes from:
My old evanswinner.com homepage, now defunct;
my less old but still fairly old evanswinner.com page;
my [account](https://twitter.com/thorne) on "X" (n√©e Twitter);
my [other](https://twitter.com/evans_h_winner) account on Twitter;
my personal [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bellsound) posts;
my old Posterous blog;
my old Wordpress blog;
my old Usenet posts;
my old Blogger blog;
some other stuff I'm forgetting.

It's mostly some nerdy tech stuff
from a curmudgeonly perspective,
and essays on philosophy and the arts
from a frankly Randian perspective.

I don't normally condone the use of the words
"tweet" or especially "meme."
But I am too lazy to here do otherwise.
I am just starting this, so it is,
as we used to say on Web 1.0, "Under construction."
