A TALE OF TWO CONDUCTORS

The  last two days I have had the oppor-
tunity to  observe  two  very  different
conductors   at   work.   I  saw  Gerard
Schwarz conduct the Seattle Symphony  on
Saturday  the 5th of June.  They did se-
lections  from  Mendelssohn’s  Midsummer
Night’s  Dream  and  his violin concerto
with James Ehnes playing the  solo  part
(he  got  off  to a bit of a slow start,
but all-in-all did a  fine  job).   They
also played Strauss’s Ein Hilden Lieben.

I’m  pleased  to report that the Seattle
Symphony is getting better  at  ignoring
Schwarz.

I  know  that’s  a pretty harsh thing to
say, but having been in a number of con-
ducted  ensembles over the years I think
that to some extent I can judge him as a
player.  When I watch him and ask myself
if I would find any of what he is  doing
useful as a player, I have to answer–oc-
casionally.

He does good cueing, I  think.   I  only
noticed a couple of “thanks for coming,”
after the fact cues.  In particular,  he
likes  to cue the violin sections at his
extreme right and left (they were seated
European style).  He does this even when
their part is obvious.  I think he likes
cueing the violins because it allows him
to turn dramatically to extreme  profile
for  the  audience.   But  that’s just a
suspicion.

He doesn’t like standard stick patterns.
I   know   that   in   passages  in  the
Mendelssohn works that are pretty clear-
ly  in  four  or  three  he  assiduously
avoided both patterns as taught to  col-
lege  freshmen.  In fact, rarely did two
measures go by with the same pattern em-
ployed  in  both.  In slow music he dis-
pensed altogether with beating time  and
more or less mimed the phrase shape.  In
faster music he seemed to be  trying  to
conduct  each  rhythmic unit separately.
When the music became  more  intense  he
liked  to  add  beats  to  the  measure.
Sometimes as many as four  or  five  ex-
tras.   Never  the same twice.  He liked
to give a lot of upbeats to big downbeat
entrances–sort of the way one would con-
duct the  opening  bars  of  Beethoven’s
Fifth  if  you wanted to conduct each of
the da da da’s.  He liked to follow that
with  a few similar afterbeats after the
downbeat too.  The orchestra  just  came
in  wherever  they had rehearsed to come
in.

We were pretty close to the front, so  I
don’t  think the speed of sound time de-
lay was much of a factor, so I  can  re-
port  that, although there was not actu-
ally any particular place  to  look  for
his downbeats, I think if I had to guess
his favorite place  for  a  downbeat  it
would  be at about the two o’clock posi-
tion in his egg pattern.  His  egg  pat-
tern was a big egg shape circle thing he
did, one to a beat, no matter  what  the
meter.   I  imagine many students of the
art of conducting wish they could  learn
that  pattern, as it looks pretty conve-
nient to use when you aren’t sure what’s
going  on.  He favored that pattern, and
come to think of it, I  was  wrong  when
above  I  said there were never two mea-
sures the same in a row.   He  used  the
egg pattern quite a lot.

When  I  first  moved to Seattle and saw
the Seattle Symphony I thought they were
terrible.   But later I saw them under a
guest conductor’s baton–someone who con-
ducts  in  a  more, shall we say, tradi-
tional manner.  And I realized that  the
Seattle Symphony is a really good group.
But every time  I  saw  Schwarz  conduct
there  were  so  many  ragged  cues  and
strange dynamics that I decided  it  was
Schwarz’s  conducting  that  does it.  I
may be wrong.  In any  case,  I  thought
Saturday’s  performance  was  good,  but
there were many instances of Schwarz ap-
pearing to try tempos and cues that were
just ignored.

In fairness to Mr. Schwarz he struck  me
as  a little more useful in the concerto
than in the Midsummer Night’s Dream.   I
think  it’s  because it would be rude to
jump and wave around too much  when  the
spotlight  is  supposed  to  be  on  the
soloist.  And then in the Strauss, which
is  a much harder piece, he mellowed out
again for  certain  parts–in  particular
for  the difficult woodwind counterpoint
bits in the first section.

If I had to guess I’d guess that the ra-
tionale  is  that  for most of what they
play–particularly for something as stan-
dard  as the first Mendelssohn piece–the
orchestra knows it  so  well  that  they
don’t need the conductor, so he’s really
just there  to  impress  the  blue-hairs
with  his wild flamboyance.  Just like a
real live eccentric musical genius.   If
that’s  the case then I’m sure they were
impressed.  He even managed one  or  two
fully  aerial  hops.   Leonard Bernstein
would be proud.

The next morning, Sunday the 6th of June
(D-Day)  I  attended eleven o’clock mass
at St. Mark’s Cathedral on Capital  Hill
in  Seattle.   They  had  the ‘Cathedral
Choir’ singing with Mel  Butler  direct-
ing.

Being  an atheist, I haven’t set foot in
a church for years.  Not a big one, any-
way.   And boy is this thing huge.  This
was, I think,  an  Episcopalian  church,
and  even  Catholics in a bad mood don’t
have  architecture  as  stern  as   this
place.  There were huge flying buttress-
es made of unremitting blank  dark  grey
concrete  and  fifty  foot stained glass
windows with nothing but cheerless  rec-
tangles of lightly tinted glass.

But  the  organ.   Man,  was  that organ
something else.  A real, bona-fide giant
of  an  organ  with 32-foot stops as big
around as oil barrels.

But I digress.

First they played a Voluntary on the or-
gan  alone.  Then conducted singing with
the choir.  But they were  obscured  be-
hind   some  kind  of  rotating  windows
structure.  I thought all was lost and I
wouldn’t  be able to see the conducting,
but then they moved to  the  loft  above
and  behind the congregation (by the or-
gan manuals).  Then there  was  a  whole
bunch of church stuff.  Stand up, listen
to a sermon...  something  about  flying
trapeze  artists...?   Strange.   Sing a
hymn from the  little  blue  book.   Sit
down.  Stand up.  Finally some conducted
choir singing that was very nicely done.
The  conducting  was  very straight-for-
ward.  You could always see the beat and
you  could  always see the downbeat.  It
was a lucky thing we sat way  in  front,
because  otherwise we wouldn’t have been
able to see the conductor.  As it was  I
had  to  turn  around to watch, and face
all those stern faces, bowed  in  silent
contemplation.

Then the priest fellow broke some commu-
nion pita bread in half.  I  hadn’t  in-
tended   to   do   the   whole  body  of
Christ/blood  of  Christ   thing.    I’m
against  cannibalism, sort of on princi-
ple.

But you know.  Everyone was doing it.

And besides, I hadn’t had breakfast that
day and being a chump, I thought we were
each going to get half a piece  of  pita
bread.   Needless  to say, all I got was
one lousy little tab of Jesus to hold me
until lunch.

But I digress.

As  an  ex-singer  I thought it would be
pretty easy to  follow  this  conductor.
He  mostly  mirrored his right hand with
his left all the time, but despite that,
his  beats  were clear, his choir stayed
together  and  he  communicated  through
size  of  pattern  and  beat styles just
what he wanted them to do, and they  did
it.   In  fact, the big chunk from some-
one’s Te Deum for chorus and organ  (I’m
afraid  I missed the name of the compos-
er)  was  really  damned  good.   Excuse
me–was  really  darned  good.   The only
other thing to report about him was  his
tendency  to  nod his head at the choir.
The more intense he wanted the music  to
get,  the  more vigorously he nodded his
head at them.  But the  bottom  line  is
that  it worked.  The conducting, rather
than merely  there  for  show,  actually
added  a musical element to the proceed-
ings.

Gerard Schwarz is bringing  the  Seattle
Symphony up the the level of a true top-
flight  band.   His  avowed  programming
system–in  which  he  tries  to gain the
trust  of  the  audience  with  standard
repertoire so that he can eventually be-
gin to slip  in  the  more  adventurous,
modern  work–is laudable in the extreme.
So it is only advisedly that I criticize
his  conducting style.  In fairness, his
methods are  no  more  guilty  of  empty
showmanship  than those of any number of
well-known  and  well-respected  conduc-
tors, and his choices of repertoire as a
recording artist are unmatched.  But  in
the  end, it is the conductors who place
the music first and above all things  in
concert–even  the blue-hairs–who rise to
the level of real greatness, such as  it
is.
