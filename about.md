title: About Evans
---
I am Evans Hawthorne Winner, 53-year-old,
lowly IT worker living in Evergreen, Colorado.
(Drop me a line if you know where I can get analytical work --
data, operations, process, whatever.)

I used to be a casual rock climber in Boulder,
later a casual scuba diver in Seattle;
I studied music composition fairly seriously at university in Boulder for several years;
later studied literature and philosophy in New Mexico where,
after twenty-something odd years of courses at many schools,
I finally graduated *summa* -- because they only counted their own courses in the GPA.
Ha! Take that, high-school guidance councilors!

My wife, [Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuyqb2sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao),
is way more interesting than me. She is a computational biologist
turned data curator and R hacker.
My son, Taavi, is also way more interesting than me.
He is eleven years old and likes video games.
