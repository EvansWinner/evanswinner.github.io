title: About Evans
---
I am Evans Hawthorne Winner. I was born in 1972 in California, but grew up in Colorado.
My first computer was a Commodore [VIC 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC-20) (in about 1983).
I used to be a semi-serious rock climber in Boulder,
later a semi-serious scuba diver in Seattle.
I studied music and composition quite seriously at Fort Lewis College
and then University of Colorado for several years;
later studied literature and philosophy at University of New Mexico, and graduated *summa*.
My personal philosophy is an unholy mixture of Aristotle, Ayn Rand -- and Alan Watts (sue me);
my biggest interests are in philosophy of art and speculative metaphysical cosmology (best mixed with brandy).

I was a system administrator (IBM "midrange" systems like AS/400)
for a number of years in Albuquerque, and am now a lead IT analyst.
I'm working on my analytical skills, with the intent to move into
operations and/or process and/or systems and/or data analysis,
while continuing my many-years fascination with Emacs, Lisp, APL,
Unix/BSD/Linux and open source hacker culture in general.

My wife,
[Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wuyqb2sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), is
frankly way more interesting than me. She is a computational biologist turned
data curator and R hacker.  My son, Taavi, is also way more interesting than me.
He is eleven years old and likes kids horror video games and making crazy videos
about the characters in them. Come to think of it, my mom,
[Ellen](https://worldshaman.org/), is also way more interesting than me. She was
a biotech patent attorney for many years while living a double life (and
continuing to) as a practicing shaman.
