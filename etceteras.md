title: Microblog and Etceteras
author: Evans Winner

Here follows, in something like chronological order,
some of the miscellaneous wreckage
I have strewn across the Internet over the years.
I link to the content instead of include it here inline
except where it is only a few lines long
as in the case of a few short poems, aphorisms, and one-liners.
Links are HTTP(S) to HTML pages unless obviously otherwise.
The quality ranges from bad to not so bad. Sue me.
Also, this is not a historical record,
so I edit freely where I want to.

Most (but not all) comes from:
My old evanswinner.com homepage;
my less old but still fairly old evanswinner.com page;
my tweets on "X" (née Twitter);
my personal Facebook posts;
my old Posterous blog;
my old Wordpress blog;
my old Usenet posts;
my old Blogger blog;
some other stuff I'm forgetting.

It's mostly some nerdy tech stuff
from a curmudgeaonly perspective,
and essays on philosophy and the arts
from a franky Randian perspective.

I am JUST starting this, so it is,
we we used to say on Web 1.0, "Under construction."
