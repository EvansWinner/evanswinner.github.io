<b>ORDO EDUARDI</b>

~~ Sancte Eduarde, ora pro nobis. ~~
   -----------------------------

In the holy name of Saint Edward --

  O Saint Edward, pray intercede for us with the Lord of Lines;
  That commands issue from our fingers with Truth;
  That we suffer lightly and with patience when we delete the wrong lines.

  Let the text be ever for us the path to righteousness;
  May we move lines with care; delete lines in humility;
  And let the lines lead us ever into the Light.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE RULE OF THE ORDER OF EDWARD
(Regula Ordinis Eduardi)

PROLOGUE

The life of the Order of Edward is the life of clarity, simplicity, and honest toil.
The brothers and sisters of the Order bind themselves to the line,
that they may learn patience, humility, and the slow correction of their faults.

Let none come to this discipline seeking glory.
Let all come seeking to be changed.

1. OF THE PRIMACY OF THE LINE

The line is the measure of all work.
One who would leap beyond the line invites confusion;
one who remains with it learns truth.

Members of the Order shall keep their attention on the line before them.
They shall resist the temptation to behold the entire page at once,
for breadth without depth is vanity.

2. OF SILENCE AND ATTENTION

When the session begins, silence shall be kept.
The practitioner shall wait for the prompt as for a word in the darkness.

Let them speak only what is necessary:
a command rightly given,
a number rightly named,
a purpose rightly held.

Idle words corrupt the buffer.

3. OF ERROR

Errors are not to be despised.
Let each error rebuke pride
and recall the practitioner to sobriety of mind.

When an error is made, let them consider its cause,
amend the command,
and proceed without bitterness.

Frequent undoing is the mark of a learner, not a failure.

4. OF MEMORY AND HISTORY

The record of what has been done shall be kept whole.
The faithful shall not hide their history nor seek to erase it in haste.

Let them examine the past commands as a mirror,
not for shame,
but for understanding.

The undisciplined mind forgets;
the disciplined mind remembers.

5. OF SUBSTITUTION

Substitution shall be practiced with caution.
Let none wield it in anger,
for great harm is done by a careless replace.

Where correction is required, let it be made with calm intent,
and let the practitioner read what they have changed,
that folly may not multiply.

6. OF SAVING AND DEPARTURE

None shall leave the session in disorder.
Let each complete their task, confirm their work,
and save with a truthful heart.

He who abandons the buffer without saving
abandons the labor given to him
and must begin again with humility.

7. OF MUTUAL DISCIPLINE

The members of the Order shall correct one another gently.
Let the skilled instruct the new without arrogance,
for all are novices before the mystery of the unseen buffer.

Rebuke shall be without mockery;
instruction without condescension;
patience without end.

8. OF THE PATRON

Saint Edward, master of the line,
guide and exemplar of steadfast editing,
is to be invoked daily.

Not for ornament do we call on him,
but for resolve:
that he may help us seek the truth in narrow places
and persevere when the screen gives no comfort.

CONCLUSIO

This Rule is given not to bind harshly
but to free the mind from distraction
and draw the practitioner toward clarity.

Those who keep it with sincerity
shall find peace in their labor,
and in the faithful tending of their lines
shall discover a quiet light.
