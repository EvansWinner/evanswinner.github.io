Opinion About the Proposed ‘’CLosing’’of humanities.philoso‐
phy.objectivism

[Lightly edited, 2023]

I am not a regular contributor  to  this  newsgroup,  but  I
would  prefer  that  it not be closed down.  The charter for
humanities.philosophy.objectivism   (h.p.o)   states    that
“[d]iscussion on h.p.o.  may consist of attempts to support,
elaborate, apply, question, or refute the tenets  of  Objec‐
tivist  philosophy  on  the  part  of participants” and that
“[t]hose who disagree with these ideas may  of  course  also
post  to  h.p.o.   for  the purposes of civilized debate and
discussion of  Objectivism.”[1]  Thus,  given  the  original
intent  of  the forum, you are asking that h.p.o be run in a
manner contrary to its design, for your convenience.

As for fora on the web, while I am surely not aware  of  all
the web sites for the discussion of Objectivism you mention,
most, if not all those of which I am aware place ideological
limits  on  the  content of contributors’ posts.  While some
such fora may be interesting occasionally for passive  read‐
ing,  or  even  useful  as pedagogical tools (though that is
questionable), under  few  circumstances  would  I  want  to
actively  contribute, because in such fora free intellectual
discussion  is  by  design  impossible:  if  the  dices  are
loaded–if  the  rules  say,  yes, you can discuss Ayn Rand’s
ideas, but only  if  you  don’t  say  anything  too  out  of
line–then you have agreed in advance that some arguments are
lost before they have started–that there  are  some  subject
that  are forbidden regardless of truth.  You have created a
system in which rational, adult conversation is in principle
impossible.

As  has  already  been pointed out, if you don’t like h.p.o,
you are free not to read it.  But, despite the fact that you
are right–most of the content here is rubbish–it is also the
last place of which I am aware that encourages free  discus‐
sion of Ayn Rand’s ideas with only social pressure, argumen‐
tative power, and (at least in theory) moderation  for  bla‐
tantly  uncivilized behavior as the means of maintaining the
“intellectual purity” you  appear  to  desire.   I  wouldn’t
trade it for a thousand “objectivismonline.net”s.

There is of course no reason why those who want to manage or
participate in such fora shouldn’t be able to do so if  they
want,  and by any rules they can dream up.  But it is a mis‐
take to think that such places allow adults to have rational
intellectual  conversations.   They are, in my opinion, pri‐
marily places where  those  with  little  true  intellectual
self‐confidence  can engage in mutual pack‐pattery–and sport
in the abuse of new  contributors.   Personally,  I  am  too
proud  to  post to a web forum in which my words are subject
to the whims of some snot‐nosed  college  student  who  read
Atlas  Shrugged  once.   If  the users of online Objectivist
fora truly have the wit, let them  come  here  in  the  full
gladiatorial light of day and make their cases, and let them
face the brunt of real attack from those who need  not  fear
secret moderatorial reprisal.  Let them step up and, as they
say, pet the pony.
