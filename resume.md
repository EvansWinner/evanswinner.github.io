#### I like to make things better...

I have about twenty-five years of varied IT experience, but it was my time
in a leadership position that taught me that what I really crave is
the opportunity to analyze systems and processes and make them more
productive, more efficient, easier, and more fun; and I deeply believe
in the power of experimentation to facilitate that process. I am
therefore looking to make a transition to an analytical role,
especially something in process improvement, operations/systems/data analysis or
business analysis.
